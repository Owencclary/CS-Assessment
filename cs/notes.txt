Results analysis:
    - The results show insert and append runtime to each speed up at the array gets smaller.
    However, the tinyArray results show insert and append runtime to increase compared the
    smallArray. Also the differences in the insert runtime varies drastically according to the
    size of the array compared to the change runtime of the append method. In summary the insert 
    function scales more than the append function. I beliebe this is because the there is a more 
    noticeable difference in the runtime for different array sizes. I believe the insert function
    scales more than the append function because for each index of the array, the insert function
    carries out an extra line of code for doubling the num.
